        <div class="row bio">
            <h5>I am a writer, researcher, and recipe-developer. Recently I started dabbling in web development, too.</h5>
            <p> In 2018 I graduted with a Masters degree in Philosophy from The University of Cape Town (UCT). My research and teaching focusses on various issues in applied ethics. I have gained broad experience as a research assistant and writer on projects ranging from the philosophy of race, to COVID-19 vaccine distribution ethics and policy in Africa. </p>
            <p> During my graduate studies my husband and I opened an artisnal home bakery, specialising in vegan doughnuts. The business now focusses on recipe development and content-creation in the food space. </p>
            <p>Apart from all that, I am a web-developer in training, currently completing an immersive full-stack web development bootcamp through HyperionDev. </p>
            <p>You can find out more about me below!</p>
